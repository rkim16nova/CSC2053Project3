Note to Professor: We were experimenting and realized that WebFlow is best utilized as a portfolio/collection website, not a personal accounting sheet website,
so we switched our website to a music collection website that displays a grid of songs/albums, and clicking on each album will direct user to a new page. The
website will be much more professional and usable that way.

Updates:
-Created a grid that displays images of the songs/albums selected for the website
-Created a unique header in the upper-left side of the page
-Created titles underneath each image to show the name of the song/album
-Tweaked with the website a little to make it look professional
