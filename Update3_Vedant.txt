Update from Vedant

Saw Ryan's work on Webflow with new project related to songs as discussed.

Proceeded to understand CMS collections.

Formatted the grid for each item in the collection.

Created a base collection of a few songs.

Created a standard page for a song item, then linked it to the songs collection.

Tweaked around with song item page till it looked decent.
